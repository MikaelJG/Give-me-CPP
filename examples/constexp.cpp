`constexpr` is used for compile-time evaluation.
It ensures that an expression or function can be computed at compile time.
It reduces runtime overhead.
The program avoids the need to perform those computations at runtime. 

The computations are already done during the compilation process, 
The program doesn't incur the additional time and resources required
to perform them during runtime execution.
