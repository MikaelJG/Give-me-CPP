VARIABLES

Every variable has a type, which represents the kind of information you can store inside of it. It tells your compiler how much memory to set aside for the variable, and it defines what you can do with the variabl

C++ is strongly typed. 

Assigning a value of one type to a different typed var leads to Undefined behavior (UB).

declare a var:
int score;

initialize the var:
score = 0

First declared, you need both:

int score = 0;

then, 
score = 6;
