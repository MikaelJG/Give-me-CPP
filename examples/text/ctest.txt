CTest is typically included as part of the CMake build system, which is commonly used to manage the build process of C++ projects on Ubuntu. To install CMake, you can use the following command:

sudo apt-get install cmake
Once CMake is installed, you can then use CTest by running the following commands in your project directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
ctest


This will build your project using CMake, and then run the test suite using CTest. Note that you will need to have a CMakeLists.txt file in your project directory in order to use CMake.

If you want to install CTest separately, you can use the following command:

arduino
Copy code
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
This will install the cmake-curses-gui package, which includes CTest.
