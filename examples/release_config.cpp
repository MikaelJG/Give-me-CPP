    Optimized for size and performance, no debugging information.
    With all optimization, now testing for code performance.

    When the Hello World program (from lesson 0.7) was built using Visual Studio,
    Executable produced in the debug configuration was 65kb, 
    Executable built in the release version was 12kb. 
    The difference is largely due to the extra debugging information kept in the debug build.
