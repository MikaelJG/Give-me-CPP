Constants

C++ supports two notions of immutability

CONST

    specifies interfaces
    passing data without fear of modification. 
    It won't be changed.

CONSTEXPR

    specifies constants
    safe placement in memory for performance. 
    Unlikely to be corrupted, evaluated at compile time. 

    double sum(const vector<double>&); // sum will not midify its argument
    const int dmv = 17;     // dmv is a named constant
    xonstexpr double max1 = 1.4*square(dmv); // OK if square(17) is a constant expression
