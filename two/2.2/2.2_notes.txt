Constants

C++ supports two notions of immutability
    const - specifies interfaces, passing data without fear of modification. It won't be changed.
    constexpr - specifies constants, safe placement in memory for performance. Unlikely to be corrupted, evaluated at compile time. 

examples:
    double sum(const vector<double>&); // sum will not midify its argument
    const int dmv = 17;     // dmv is a named constant
    xonstexpr double max1 = 1.4*square(dmv); // OK if square(17) is a constant expression
