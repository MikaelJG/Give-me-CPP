#pragma once is a non-standard directive that serves as an include guard. 
It ensures that a header file is included only once during the compilation process,
regardless of how many times it is referenced.

Placed at the beginning of a header file, it acts as a compiler directive to prevent multiple inclusions
Supported by most compilers, including GCC, Clang, and MSVC.
