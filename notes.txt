CHAPTER 2 (short sightseeing tout of a city)

C++ is a compiled language (necessity).
Compilers produce object files. These are linked, yielding an executable program.

A C++ programhas many source code files, calles "source files".

An executable program is not portable. Yet, the source code can be compiled and run on a variety of systems.

The ISO C++ standard defines two kinds of entities:
    - Core language features (char, int, etc.) and loops (for and while)
    - Standard-library components (containers [vector, map, etc] and I/O operations [<<, getline(), etc.])

The standard-library is ordinary C++ code. 
C++ is expressive and efficient enough for the most demanding system tasks.

C++ is a statically typed language.
The type of every entity (object, value, name and expression) must be given to compile.
The type of an object determine the set of operations applicable to it.
