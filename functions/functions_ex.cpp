Certainly! Here are some more common built-in functions in C++:

    isalpha() - checks if a character is an alphabet letter
    isdigit() - checks if a character is a digit
    isalnum() - checks if a character is an alphanumeric character
    isspace() - checks if a character is a white-space character (e.g. space, tab, newline)
    tolower() - converts a character to lowercase
    toupper() - converts a character to uppercase
    strcpy() - copies a string
    strcat() - concatenates two strings
    strlen() - returns the length of a string
    strcmp() - compares two strings
    strchr() - finds the first occurrence of a character in a string
    strstr() - finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string
    abs() - returns the absolute value of a number
    ceil() - rounds a number up to the nearest integer
    floor() - rounds a number down to the nearest integer
    pow() - raises a number to a given power
    sqrt() - returns the square root of a number
    rand() - generates a random number

There are many more built-in functions in C++, but these are some of the most commonly used ones.

    cout and cin: for input and output operations.
    strlen: to determine the length of a string.
    strcmp: to compare two strings.
    strcat: to concatenate two strings.
    stoi: to convert a string to an integer.
    stod: to convert a string to a double.
    tolower and toupper: to convert a character to lowercase or uppercase.
    abs: to get the absolute value of a number.
    sqrt: to calculate the square root of a number.
    pow: to raise a number to a certain power.
    rand: to generate a random number.
    time: to get the current time.
    exit: to terminate the program.
