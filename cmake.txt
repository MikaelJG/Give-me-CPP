CMake

    A Cross-platform build system that generates native build files and manages the build process of a project. 

    CMake can generate build files for different platforms and compilers, including Makefiles, Visual Studio project files, and Xcode project files. 

    Once the build files are generated, the actual compilation and linking are performed by the respective platform-specific tools, such as gcc or clang for C++ compilation and linking on Linux.
