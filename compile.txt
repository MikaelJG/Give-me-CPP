When you program in C++, you mainly go through 4 phases during development:

    Code — writing the program
    Save — saving the program
    Compile — compiling via the terminal
    Execute — executing via the terminal

    Debug (after this cycle)

COMPILING

Compiling is translating the C++ program and creating a machine code file.

The executable is loaded to computer memory.
The computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program.

A.OUT 

The default name is a.out. A stands for “assembler”, the OUT for “output”.

If you’ve compiled a program and have executed the executable named a.out, 

The source code is all within the executable, thus removable after the compilation

with G++ 

Name the executable: 

g++ hello.cpp -o hello
